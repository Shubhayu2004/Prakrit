ntroduction 

 

These days, in the busy lives of people it is hard to track many things at the same time, specifically the Health and Environment section is hard to keep track of, which will affect the environment indirectly and gradually. 

The (app name) will make sure the person using the application ensures that the user can keep track of and contribute to the environment. This app focuses primarily on the Sustainable Development Goals. 

 

Sustainable development goals concentrated: 

SDG 13: Climate Action: 

By encouraging users to track and reduce their carbon footprint, your application supports efforts to address climate change and contributes to individual and collective actions for climate mitigation. 

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being: 

Promoting sustainable practices and a healthier environment indirectly contributes to the well-being of individuals and communities. 

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production: 

Your application can contribute to promoting responsible consumption by helping users understand and reduce their carbon footprint, make sustainable choices, and minimize environmental impact. 

 

 

How does our application work?  

The application when installed by the user, initially asks questions, by which the (name of the app), will get to understand the possible way the user’s lifestyle is. 

 

The next process is based on the interaction with the user. A Global Reference is taken just in case to avoid the discrepancy of the user data. Then the User is allowed to take photos and, he/she has the choice to store it as a memory or to post it in the community of people contributing to the environment. Food, vehicles, and other related photos are allowed in this application to be posted or stored in memory. 

 

This process encourages the User to contribute to the environment. Based on these photos, and the weekly welfare quiz, the data stored is updated weekly.  

 

Standard values of the carbon footprints are stored in the data given to the application. With the interaction record of the user, weekly carbon footprint results are shown to the user and also allow the user to post it in the community. 

 

The Standard Data might not reach the expectations of some users, so the app is designed in a way that it takes feedback from the User to standardize the data, which will be relevant to the global reference point.
